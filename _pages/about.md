My work focuses on better understand the fate and transport of contaminants in the groundwater and better assess the consequences of these contaminations. This includes the development of numerical solutions to simulate reactive transport in heterogeneous aquifers, transport upscaling and the application of stochastic approaches to account for uncertainty on predictions.
