My work focuses on the better understanding and prediction of the fate and transport of contaminants in groundwater. This includes the development of numerical solutions to simulate reactive transport in heterogeneous aquifers, transport upscaling and the application of stochastic approaches to account for uncertainty on predictions at the local to the basin scale. I have the chance to be working with exciting and brillant people at the [Department of Land, Air and Water Resources](lawr.ucdavis.edu/) of the University of California Davis ([Thomas Harter](http://groundwater.ucdavis.edu/People/) and [Graham Fogg](http://lawr.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/fogg-graham}'s groups)).

======
**<span style = "font-size:1em;">Langrangian (particle tracking) method to simulate reactive transport in heterogeneous aquifers</span>**<br/>
Build stable solution for linear and non-linear reactive transport under complex (realistic) conditions; helps understand key transport processes

**<span style = "font-size:1em;">Stochastic assessment of regional scale contamination of agricultural original</span>**<br/>
Improve the management of groundwater quality following an agricultural contamination (nitrate, pesticide, ...) at the regional scale by accounting for uncertainty related to imperfect aquifer representation.

**<span style = "font-size:1em;">Upscaling of transport for regional scale application</span>**<br/>
Development of methods to reproduce transport characteristics associated to local heterogeneity in large scale models. These methods include the Multirate-Mass Transfer approach.

Application of stochastic theory to aquifer contamination leading to adverse effect on the human health.
